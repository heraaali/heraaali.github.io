I discovered shortcuts for Jupyter Notebook entirely by accident - I hit D twice and, to my horror, deleted a cell. Can’t win them all, but you can learn a host of useful shortcuts!

If you don't already use Jupyter, I highly recommend it. I often use it as a playground for dealing with unfamiliar data. I've found it a great tool for data cleaning, visualization, and quick scratch work. I also like how convenient it is to share a notebook, since you can easily turn the file into a polished PDF.

### Note
Jupyter Notebooks have two different keyboard input modes.  
**Command mode** - binds the keyboard to notebook-level actions. Indicated by a grey cell border with a blue left margin. Press esc to enable.  
**Edit mode** - this is when you’re typing in a cell and is indicated by a green cell border. Press enter to enable.
## Shortcuts:
If you are using a Windows OS, replace the `cmd` with `ctrl`.
