I use Jupyter Notebook both at my day job and for my own projects - if you've used it, you know it's a great tool for data cleaning, visualization, and quick scratch work. And I discovered shortcuts for it entirely by accident: I hit D twice and, to my horror, deleted a cell. Can’t win them all, but you can learn a host of useful shortcuts!

### Note
Jupyter Notebooks have two different keyboard input modes.  

**Command mode** - binds the keyboard to notebook-level actions. Indicated by a grey cell border with a blue left margin. Press esc to enable.  

**Edit mode** - this is when you’re typing in a cell and is indicated by a green cell border. Press enter to enable.
## Shortcuts:
If you are using a Windows OS, replace the `cmd` with `ctrl`.
