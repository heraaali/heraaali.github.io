Math is intrinsically a creative subject, but most schools teach rote memorization instead of encouraging out-of-the-box thinking. What I love about math is how approaching a problem from a different perspective can simplify it significantly. For example, let's look at percentages.  

## Understanding Percentages

Quick, what's 50% of 18? It probably didn't take you long to come up with 9.

What's 18% of 50? 

...

That answer might have taken you longer, but 18% of 50 is also 9! Coincidence? Nope, this holds true for all percentages.

### How it works:


$$50\% \text{ of } 18 =\\$$
  
$$\frac{50}{100} × 18=\\$$

$$50 × \frac{1}{100} × 18=\\$$

$$50 × \frac{18}{100}\\$$


Multiplication is commutative, so switch around the values to get: 

$$\frac{18}{100} × 50=\\$$

$$18\% \text{ of } 50\\$$
  
And there you go! If you are ever having trouble taking a percentage, try flipping the two numbers to see if it makes it easier. This example doesn't rely on advanced knowledge because I believe if you get comfortable with the basic principles, you'll have the building blocks to get creative and curious about math.
