Git can get a little confusing when you’re first starting out. Here’s a list of commands to use as a reference - I’ve included the basic commands, and a few that I can never seem to remember!


| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
git status | Check the status of the current branch.
git branch | List the current branches.
git pull | Get changes from a remote branch.
git add | Add the changed file to the commit.
git fetch | Fetch remote branches
git fetch -p | Fetch remote branches and clean up references to deleted remote branches.
git push -u origin remote-branch | Create a remote branch from a local branch.
git checkout -b feature-branch | Create a new feature branch.
git checkout -b feature-branch | Create a local feature branch from a remote branch
git reset | Undo all adds.
git reset ~HEAD | Reset to last checkout.
