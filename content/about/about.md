Hi, I’m Heraa.

I am a software engineer at Intel. Before that, I studied applied mathematics at UC Berkeley. I am especially interested in the space where math, coding, and communication meet up and hang out.

When I’m not building products, you can find me doing yoga, reading, or traveling somewhere new.

Feel free to drop a line if you’d like to connect!
