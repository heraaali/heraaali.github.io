Hi, I’m Heraa.

I am a software engineer at Intel. Before that, I studied applied mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. I made this website to talk about side projects & to share tutorials from what I've learned along the way. More than anything, I am interested in exploring the space where math, coding, and communication meet up and hang out.

When I’m not building products, you can find me doing yoga, reading, or traveling somewhere new.
