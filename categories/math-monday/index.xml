      <description>In mathematics, a proof is an argument to convince the reader that something holds true in all conditions, beyond any doubt. There are more examples of artful proofs than I could possibly document, so I chose a visual proof that should be easy to grasp. Let&#39;s prove the following:
\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{2^n} = 1\]
A refresher on summations: \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{2^n}\) is a shorthand way to describe adding the terms, where, starting from n=1, \(\frac{1}{2^1} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{2^3} + .</description>

      <description>Math is intrinsically a creative subject, but most schools teach rote memorization instead of encouraging out-of-the-box thinking. What I love about math is how approaching a problem from a different perspective can simplify it significantly. For example, let&#39;s look at percentages.
Understanding Percentages Quick, what&#39;s 50% of 18? It probably didn&#39;t take you long to come up with 9.
What&#39;s 18% of 50?
...
That answer might have taken you longer, but 18% of 50 is also 9!</description>
