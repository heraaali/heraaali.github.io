      <title>Math Monday: Introducing A Visual Proof</title>

      <description>In mathematics, a proof is an argument to convince the reader that something holds true in all conditions, beyond any doubt. There are more examples of artful proofs than I could possibly document, so I chose a visual proof that should be easy to grasp. Let&#39;s prove the following:
\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{2^n} = 1\]
A refresher on summations: \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{2^n}\) is a shorthand way to describe adding the terms, where, starting from n=1, \(\frac{1}{2^1} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{2^3} + .</description>

      <title>Math Monday: Calculating Percentages</title>

      <description>Math is intrinsically a creative subject, but most schools teach rote memorization instead of encouraging out-of-the-box thinking. What I love about math is how approaching a problem from a different perspective can simplify it significantly. For example, let&#39;s look at percentages.
Understanding Percentages Quick, what&#39;s 50% of 18? It probably didn&#39;t take you long to come up with 9.
What&#39;s 18% of 50?
...
That answer might have taken you longer, but 18% of 50 is also 9!</description>

      <title>Spotify Data Analysis</title>
      <link>http://www.heraaali.com/blog/spotify/</link>

      <description>After Spotify did their end-of-the-year summary of my listening history, I was inspired to do more analysis on my listening data. Instead of just including the output of my work, I am going to go through my code to provide an easy-to-follow resource if you&#39;re a programmer who is new to Python, although I am assuming familiarity with coding in general.
If you request it, Spotify will let you download a year&#39;s worth of listening history.</description>

      <title>Jupyter Notebook Tips</title>
      <link>http://www.heraaali.com/blog/jupyter/</link>

      <description>I use Jupyter Notebook both at my day job and for my own projects - if you&#39;ve used it, you know it&#39;s a great tool for data cleaning, visualization, and quick scratch work. And I discovered shortcuts for it entirely by accident: I hit D twice and, to my horror, deleted a cell. Can’t win them all, but you can learn a host of useful shortcuts!
Note Jupyter Notebook has two different keyboard input modes.</description>

      <title>Making a Website</title>

      <description>To make this website, I used the Hugo static site generator and am hosting my site on GitHub pages. What does that mean?
GitHub Pages allows you to host a static site, either on the github.io domain or a custom domain, and is free if you have a GitHub account. I created a GitHub user/organization page, which means that my site is available at &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io. The steps are outlined in the documentation for GitHub pages.</description>

      <description>Hi, I’m Heraa.
I am a software engineer at Intel. Before that, I studied applied mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. I am interested in the space where math, coding, and communication meet up and hang out. When I am not writing code, you can find me doing yoga, reading, or traveling somewhere new.
I&#39;m happy just because.</description>
